				<p><img src="canucklogo.jpg" width="100" height="125" align="left">My name is Michael Walker and I am very excited to begin studying and eventually obtaining a degree in Computer Science. I was born in Vancouver, BC and, due to my Father’s job, proceeded to move to Calgary, AB followed by a small city in Washington State called Enumclaw. Here I stayed for all of high school and after which, applied to University of Washington. I wasn’t sure as to what career I wanted to follow at this point in my life, however I soon received notice that I was pre-admitted into the UW Business School and decided that was career path I’d pursue. Fast forward another five years and I had graduated with a degree in Accounting with a job offer to work at Ernst and Young, a public accounting/auditing firm in the San Antonio, TX office. So after graduating I drove down to Texas and worked a year as a public accountant, auditing financial statements for multiple Global Fortune 500 publically traded companies.
				</p>
				<p>However, after a year of working as an accountant I finally accepted the fact that this was not the career/job I had envisioned I’d be working towards. Throughout my life I’ve had in intense interest in programming and all things computer related and I began to realize it wasn’t too late to change the course of my life so I decided to make a sudden and immediate change. I applied to OSU to obtain a degree in Computer Science as well as interviewing for and getting a job as an IT Auditor – in an attempt to combine my past experience as well as begin my transition towards a Computer Science related field – more specifically software engineering.
